# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Success-Predictor
The SpaceX Falcon 9 is a reusable rocket that SpaceX built to launch payloads into orbit. The Falcon 9 rocket's first stage is intended to re-enter the atmosphere after launch and touch down vertically on a predetermined landing pad or drone ship. Therefore, we have developed a ML model to predict success rate of these launches.
